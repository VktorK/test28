# ![Laravel Test28 App](logo.png)

# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/VktorK/test28.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd test28

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Update all the dependencies using composer

    composer update

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Generate L5-Swagger service

    php artisan l5-swagger:generate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

You can now access the swagger at http://localhost:8000/api/swagger

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone https://github.com/VktorK/test28.git
    cd test28
    composer install
    composer update
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan jwt:generate
    php artisan l5-swagger:generate
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, roles, cars, car-brands, car-models. This can help you to quickly start testing the api and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php

Or run the database seeder and enjou

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

# Testing API

Run the laravel development server

    php artisan serve

The api can now be accessed at

    http://localhost:8000/api/swagger
 
# Authentication
 
This applications uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to handle authentication. The token is passed with each request using the `Authorization` header with `Token` scheme. The JWT authentication middleware handles the validation and authentication of the token. Please check the following sources to learn more about JWT.

# L5 Swagger - OpenApi or Swagger Specification for Laravel project (L5-Swagger)
 
This package is a wrapper of Swagger-php and swagger-ui adapted to work with Laravel. The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All L5-Swagger does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. The default configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:8000/api/swagger`
